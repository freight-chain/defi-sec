# Price Oracles 

## Relationships 
Market Attacks,Off-Chain, On-Chain, Exchanges

## Description 
The oracle needs at least 50% of the individual prices to be accurate for the median to be accurate as well. In an event of a sudden, extreme, asset price variation, the median price reported by the oracle would only reflect the new price once 50% of the sources report on the new price. As a consequence, the Open Oracle may not reflect sudden, extreme, variations in a timely manner.

## Remediation
Proposals to address the problem:

To better reflect price variations, consider not only calculating the median of the individual prices reported for a given asset, but also computing their standard deviation.

Be aware of the associated risks during times of high price volatility, and implement the necessary logic to adapt to potential delays in the prices reported by the oracle.
